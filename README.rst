===================================
Craton (OpenStack Fleet Management)
===================================

Craton is a fleet management tool set that helps operators manage
their OpenStack cloud environments.  Craton provides operators with
monitoring and auditing to provide reports and alerts on resource status
to help maintain cloud health. Craton uses a relational database to persist
inventory information. SQLAlchemy will be used for modeling, with Alembic
supporting migrations.  The inventory database is completely encapsulated
by a CLI, REST, and python API.
